## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Talon Voice:** Make sure you have Talon Voice installed and configured. If not, visit [talonvoice.com](https://talonvoice.com/).
* **Community Talon:** You'll need the community Talon repository for this library to function correctly. 

### 2. Installation

    * Copy (or drag and drop) the `community` folder into your `~/.talon/user/` directory.

### üìÇ Game Folders

Each game will have its own folder within the `game_library` directory. Inside, you'll find:

* `.talon` files containing the voice commands and scripts.
* Any supporting files (e.g., images, configuration files).
* If the game supports eye tracking, the folder will have `(Eye Tracking)` in a txt file.
* A list of commands for users to read.
